# hello-world
Nothing special here to see. This is my first repository.
My name is Jordan and I am a student at CSUF studying mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science. The year is 2018 and I am new to c++ and currently taking data structures. I am learning valuable information that will help me program mechanical devices in my career and develop software solutions to integrate with machines.
